# Exclam! A Chess Coordinates trainer

Do you want to seem like you know what you're talking about when playing chess? Are you trying to follow along with your favorite chess streamers as they rattle off line after line? Are you like me also incredibly demotivated to actually go through the effort of learning coordinates properly? Well, that's what we're trying to solve.

Exlam! tries to gamify learning chess coordinates to keep you motivated. We break the board up into 4 parts, learn the parts separately and then slowly put them together. 

# Found an Issue?

That's not surprising, this whole thing was put together in a few hours. [Report issues here](https://github.com/c00/chess-exclam/issues). Please be specific. Pull requests are also very welcome.

I make no promises on what I will fix and whatnot.

## Motivational sentences

You may have noticed the app tries to be cute and motivate you to keep going. I would like to have a lot more motivational sentences for both wins and losses. So if you have suggestions, definitely create an issue with your suggestions.
